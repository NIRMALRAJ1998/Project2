# Project2
**Phonepe Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project involves extracting, transforming, and visualizing metrics and statistics from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The goal is to extract raw data, process it, and present it through a dynamic and interactive geo-visualization dashboard. The solution includes data extraction, transformation, and storage, followed by building a user-friendly dashboard with Plotly and Streamlit.

**Steps Implemented**
1. Data Extraction
Scripting to clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and extract relevant data files.
2. Data Transformation and Cleaning
Data is transformed into a structured format, and necessary pre-processing steps such as handling missing data, data normalization, and filtering are performed.
3. Data Storage
The transformed data is inserted into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
4. Geo-Visualization Dashboard
A live, interactive dashboard is created using Streamlit and Plotly to visualize the data on a geographic scale. The dashboard allows users to explore various metrics such as transaction volume, active users, etc., across different regions.
5. Data Retrieval
The data is fetched from the MySQL database and displayed dynamically on the dashboard based on user inputs.
6. Interactive User Interface
The dashboard includes at least 10 dropdown options, allowing users to select and visualize different metrics and statistics based on their needs.

**Technologies Used**
Python (for scripting and data manipulation)
MySQL (for data storage)
Streamlit (for dashboard creation)
Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
Git (for cloning the GitHub repository)
Features
Interactive geo-visualization of PhonePe data.
Dropdowns to choose between different metrics and figures.
Real-time data fetching from the MySQL database.
User-friendly and intuitive interface.

**Conclusion**
This project successfully processes large-scale data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and visualizes it through an interactive dashboard. It provides valuable insights that can help in understanding trends and making informed decisions. The solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly, offering a seamless experience to users looking to explore PhonePe's transaction data.
